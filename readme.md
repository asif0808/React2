# ðŸš€ My React Journey

Welcome to my React learning journey!  
This repo is a collection of **mini-projects**, and **concept demos** as I refresh and deepen my understanding of React.

## ðŸ§  Learning Goals

- Write clean, reusable components
- Practice state and prop drilling
- Understand hooks deeply (esp. `useEffect`)
- Improve component structure and styling
- Build full CRUD apps with backend integration
